jiagra: Javascript/Website Performance Enhancement

jiagra is a stand-alone javascript API for automatic website
performance enhancement. Currently, it contains a pseudo-polyfill
for pre-rendering/pre-fetching. This allows the page to load/cache
files you expect the user to be accessing, such as the next link.

Using actual browser prerendering is only supported in a handful
of bleeding-edge browsers, however this polyfill should work in
any browser!

This allows pages to be pre-cached by the browser and ready to load
as soon as the user clicks, specifically determined by the website
maintainer (or smarty-pants code that figures out which pages are
accessed most).


INSTALLATION:

Simply add the script to your page like so:
<script src="jiagra.js"></script>

Then add pre-render/pre-fetch links to any URLs you want ready ASAP:
<link rel="prerender" href="http://example.org/index.html">
or
<link rel="prefetch"  href="/images/big.jpeg">

That's it!
