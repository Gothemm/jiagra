jiagra is a stand-alone javascript API for automatic performance
enhancement. Currently, it contains a pseudo-polyfill for
pre-rendering/pre-fetching, which currently is only supported in
a handful of bleeding-edge browsers.

This allows pages to be pre-cached by the browser and ready to load
as soon as the user clicks.

INSTALLATION:
Simply add the script to your page like so:
<script src="jiagra.js"></script>

That's it!
